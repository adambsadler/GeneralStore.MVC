# General Store MVC

**By Adam Sadler**

This Eleven Fifty Academy project walked us through developing an MVC application by reconstructing a previous API project we completed. It contained the following classes:
- 'Product' This class includes an ID, Name, Price, and Stock Quantity properties. In addtion, it has a bool property indicating whether or not it is food.
- 'Customer' This class includes an ID, First name, and Last Name.
- 'Transaction' This class includes an ID, Product ID (foreign key), Customer ID (foreign key), and a Product Count.

While we used a walkthrough for the first two classes, we were left to figure out how to implment the Transaction class on our own.
